# ✅ RAILWAY DOCKERFILE - FIXED!

## 🚨 Problem

The Dockerfile was trying to copy specific files that weren't in the build context:
```
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: 
"/manifest.json": not found
```

---

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Simplified Dockerfile
Changed from:
```dockerfile
COPY voyagr_web.py .
COPY service-worker.js .
COPY manifest.json .
```

To:
```dockerfile
COPY . .
```

This copies all files from the repository into the container.

### 2. Added .dockerignore
Created `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files:
- Documentation (*.md)
- Test files (test_*.py)
- Build artifacts (*.apk, *.aab)
- Database files (*.db)
- Large data files (SCDB_*, cameras.geojson)
- IDE files (.vscode, .idea)
- Python cache (__pycache__)

## 📦 Files Updated

| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Dockerfile | ✅ Fixed | Simplified to use COPY . . |
| .dockerignore | ✅ Created | Excludes unnecessary files |

---

## 🔧 Dockerfile Changes

**Before:**
```dockerfile
COPY voyagr_web.py .
COPY service-worker.js .
COPY manifest.json .
```

**After:**
```dockerfile
COPY . .
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No more "file not found" errors
- ✅ Simpler and more maintainable
- ✅ Works with any file structure
- ✅ .dockerignore keeps image size small
