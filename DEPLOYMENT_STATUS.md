## What to Expect After Deployment

### On Mobile (Railway.app)
1. Calculate route from Barnsley to Balby
2. Enable "Avoid Speed Cameras" in Settings
3. You should see:
   - ⚠️ Hazards Detected section in route preview
   - 16 red warning icons (🚨) on the map
   - Hazard count: 16
   - Time penalty: 768 min

### Local Testing (Already Working)
- Run `python test_api_response.py` to see API response with hazards
- Run `python test_cache_fix.py` to verify cache works correctly
- Both tests pass ✅

## Timeline

- **Now**: All code committed to GitHub ✅
- **5-15 minutes**: Railway.app auto-deploys changes
- **After deployment**: Changes live on mobile

## How to Verify Deployment

1. Open Railway.app URL on mobile
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Calculate route with hazard avoidance enabled
4. Look for:
   - Red warning icons on map
   - ⚠️ Hazards Detected section
   - Hazard count and penalty

## If Changes Don't Appear

1. **Clear browser cache** - Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Settings → Clear Data
2. **Hard refresh** - Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
3. **Wait 15 minutes** - Railway.app may still be deploying
4. **Check browser console** - F12 → Console tab for errors
