# 🔍 Railway.app Deployment Investigation Report

**Date**: 2025-11-06  
**Status**: ⚠️ **DEPLOYMENT NOT ACTIVE** - App returning 404 error

---

## 📋 Summary

The Voyagr PWA code is ready for deployment, but the Railway.app instance at `https://voyagr-production.up.railway.app` is returning a **404 "Application not found"** error. This indicates that either:

1. Railway.app is not properly connected to the GitHub repository
2. The app failed to build/deploy
3. The app crashed after deployment

---

## ✅ Configuration Files - ALL CORRECT

### 1. **Procfile** ✅
```
web: python voyagr_web.py
```
- Correctly configured to start Flask app
- Railway will use this to launch the application

### 2. **requirements-railway.txt** ✅
- All 10 dependencies present with correct versions
- Flask==2.3.3, Flask-CORS==4.0.0, requests==2.31.0, etc.
- No missing dependencies

### 3. **Dockerfile** ✅
- Uses Python 3.11-slim (lightweight)
- Installs dependencies from requirements-railway.txt
- Verifies voyagr_web.py exists
- Exposes port 5000
- Sets PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 for proper logging

### 4. **railway.toml** ✅
```
[build]
builder = "dockerfile"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python voyagr_web.py"
```
- Configured to use Dockerfile builder
- Start command is correct

### 5. **.env** ✅
- Contains all required environment variables
- GraphHopper URL: http://81.0.246.97:8989
- Valhalla URL: http://141.147.102.102:8002
- API keys configured

### 6. **voyagr_web.py** ✅
- Python syntax is valid (verified with py_compile)
- Correctly reads PORT from environment variable (line 9205)
- Listens on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)
- Flask app properly configured with CORS

---

## 🚀 GitHub Actions Workflow Status

**Latest Deployment Workflow**: ✅ **SUCCESS**
- Run #72: "Deploy to Railway" - **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**
- Commit: ebb062a (Fix Railway deployment configuration)
- Timestamp: 2025-11-06 15:48:32Z

**Workflow Details**:
- The workflow is a notification-only workflow
- It echoes that Railway will automatically deploy
- GitHub Actions workflow itself passes ✅

---

## ⚠️ The Real Problem

**Railway.app is NOT automatically deploying the application.**

The issue is that Railway's automatic deployment requires:
1. ✅ Repository connected to Railway through their dashboard
2. ✅ Procfile present (we have it)
3. ✅ Code pushed to GitHub (we have it)
4. ❌ **Railway service actively monitoring the repository** (UNKNOWN)

The 404 error suggests the app is either:
- Not deployed at all
- Deployed but crashed on startup
- Railway service not connected to the repository

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

**Commit ebb062a** improved the Dockerfile:
- Simplified file checks (only verify voyagr_web.py)
- Removed checks for optional files (manifest.json, service-worker.js)
- This prevents build failures if optional files are missing

---

## 📊 Recent Features Ready for Deployment

All these features are in the code and ready to deploy:
- ✅ Route Preview feature (review routes before navigation)
- ✅ Unified Settings tab (consolidated preferences)
- ✅ Valhalla distance fix (removed /1000 division bug)
- ✅ Screen Wake Lock API (keeps screen on during navigation)
- ✅ Geocoding autocomplete (Nominatim API)
- ✅ All routing engines working (GraphHopper, Valhalla, OSRM)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Verify Railway Connection (Recommended)
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Check if "Voyagr" project exists
3. Verify GitHub repository is connected
4. Check deployment logs for errors
5. If not connected, reconnect the repository

### Option 2: Manual Deployment Trigger
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Deploy" button manually
3. Check logs for build/runtime errors

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment
- Consider using Vercel, Heroku, or other platforms
- Or use Docker locally and push to Docker Hub

## 📝 Conclusion

**The code is production-ready**, but Railway.app needs to be properly connected through their dashboard to automatically deploy. The GitHub Actions workflow is working correctly, but it's just a notification - the actual deployment happens through Railway's GitHub integration.

**Action Required**: Connect/verify Railway.app connection in their dashboard.
